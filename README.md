# Kotlin Demo Higher Order Functions

In Kotlin, a higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments and/or returns a function as its result. Higher-order functions are used to enable more concise and expressive code, as well as to implement advanced programming concepts such as functional programming and the use of lambdas.
